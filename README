JourneyTimeCalculator is the main calss which has the method calculateTimeTaken.
This method takes Route object which holds the list of Stretches. calculateTimeTaken method iterates through Stretch object and calculates the time taken.

Refer to TestJourneyTimeCalculator for sample usage of JourneyTimeCalculator 

Route route = new Route();
route.addStretch(new GoodStretch(2));
route.addStretch(new BadStretch(2));
JourneyTimeCalculator calc = new JourneyTimeCalculator();
long time = calc.calculateTimeTaken(route);

Refactoring carried

1. Route was exposing streches object by public getter method. Now there is no need to give it out. Even if required Iterator might be a better option.So JourneyTimeCalculator object was not required.
2. Speed was a property of the Car so created new Car object and average speed as property.
3. Based on the type stretch speed of vehicle varies so adjusting the speed is part of time calculation.

New code will look like-

		Route route = new Route();
		route.addStretch(new GoodStretch(0.0f));
		Car car = new Car(60.0f / 60);
		long time = route.calculateTimeTaken(car);
